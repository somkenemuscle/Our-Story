            <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-3">How it all <i>began</i></h1>
            <p>
                September 11th, 2023 ‚Äî Monday. Who would have known that this day would mark the beginning of
                something that would become one of the most important parts of my life? Well, it did. I met Zainab
                Kassim Temitope on that special day at Aptech.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                It all started when we were asked who wanted to be class rep. Without hesitation, I raised my hand, eager to take on the challenge.
                Then came the request for an assistant class rep. She raised her hand, too. And that‚Äôs when we first exchanged glances, then quick chats.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                As time passed, we found ourselves joining Google Meets together, preparing for exams, quizzing each other,
                doing Q&A sessions‚Äîit became one of the most unique and memorable experiences of my life. I‚Äôm beyond grateful I got to share that journey with you.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                And who would‚Äôve known that, in the process, I‚Äôd fall so deeply in love with you? But I did. I fell hard, even though reality kicked in‚Äîwe came from different
                religions at the time. But despite the differences, we found common ground and built something beautiful.
            </p>

            <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-3">The <i>Halt</i> & Reality</h1>
            <p>
                October to December 2023, a time we both remember as one of the hardest in our relationship. We loved each other so deeply that, even
                though we knew our future together seemed impossible due to our differences in religion, we made the decision to stay together for as
                long as we could, until you left Aptech.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                This period was tough‚Äîbrutal, in fact. But there was also fun. It was during this time that we had our first kiss üòÇ‚ÄîI remember how it felt. We both do. It was so special.
                Amidst the emotional rollercoaster, you started growing‚Äîyour skills in HTML, CSS, and coding in general began to shine. It was incredible watching you evolve.

            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                While all of these beautiful things were happening, there was still a looming halt on the future of our relationship. We had a
                deadline. The thought of parting ways was painful and heart-wrenching for both of us, but we came to accept it. And instead of letting the
                uncertainty overwhelm us, we chose to focus on the present, to enjoy every moment we had together.
            </p>



            <p className="font-semibold text-gray-500 mt-20">Chapter 3</p>
            <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-3">The <i>Dream</i> Became Reality</h1>
            <p>
                January to December of 2024 ‚Äî this period was one of the most transformative experiences of our lives. From no hope to hope,
                from nothing to something, from a deadline to a future. You started
                exploring and diving deep into matters of faith, and you chose Jesus.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                At the time, we were so focused on the deadline that we didn‚Äôt even realize our relationship status could go from having a deadline to having a future and commitment. But then, a week after your birthday, on February 24th, 2024, we were on one of our usual Friday afternoon calls. I asked, ‚ÄúWhy do we still have a deadline when the thing that was holding us back‚Äîour religion‚Äîdoesn‚Äôt even pose an issue anymore?‚Äù

            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
                And that‚Äôs when we both realized it‚Ä¶ "Wait, that‚Äôs true!" üòÇ That was a turning point for us.
                This marked the second phase of our relationship. Of course, with a commitment came the need to build a solid foundation. We even had a brief period where we took a break from each other, only to come back stronger after everything had been resolved.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-5">
                But now, we had a goal. We were both committed to ourselves, growing together in our relationship, putting God first, avoiding temptation, and both desiring to spend the rest of our lives together. And honestly, all I can say is that I am so incredibly happy to be growing and sharing this whole experience with you, my love.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-5">
                I love you so, so, so, so much, and I am so proud of the God-fearing, strong, emotionally intelligent, and hardworking woman you‚Äôve become.
                <br />
                Happy 18th birthday üéâ, my love. Mauhhhhhhhhh ‚ù§Ô∏è!
